# Betaflight SITL Interface — M0 Findings

## 1. Pinned version and build
- Tag: 2026.6.2, commit: e0b7bb01b17b21351057e9ead2d1ab39dd44fa16
- Build host: WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04, gcc 13.3, GNU make 4.3
- Build command: `bash scripts/build-sitl.sh` → `make TARGET=SITL EXTRA_FLAGS="-DENABLE_GAZEBO_BRIDGE=0" -j$(nproc)`
- Binary: `obj/main/betaflight_SITL.elf` (also copied to `obj/betaflight_2026.6.2_SITL`)
- `EXTRA_FLAGS` is honoured (Makefile line 398 appends it to CFLAGS), so compile-time switches that are tested with `#ifndef`/`#if` (e.g. `ENABLE_GAZEBO_BRIDGE`, `ENABLE_SIMULATOR_GYROPID_SYNC`) can be set without patching. Features that `target.h` explicitly `#undef`s cannot.
- Deviations from assumptions: none in the source. One build-script fix: the Makefile initialises git submodules on demand, which races on `.git/config` under `-j`; the script now runs `git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1` first.
- Confirmed in source: UDP ports 9001 (raw PWM out), 9002 (motors out), 9003 (state in), 9004 (RC in); `--config <file>` and `--ip <addr>` options; legacy-bridge gyro map `(x, −y, −z)` in `sitl_gyro.h`; `EEPROM_FILENAME "eeprom.bin"` (relative to the working directory); `ENABLE_SIMULATOR_GYROPID_SYNC` commented out by default; real attitude estimator (`USE_IMU_CALC`) on unless `-DSITL_ATTITUDE_DIRECT`.
- `target.h` `#undef`s (relevant to later milestones): `USE_ADC`, `USE_OSD`, `USE_SERIALRX`, `USE_SERIALRX_CRSF`, `USE_TELEMETRY_CRSF`, `USE_VTX_COMMON`, `USE_VTX_CONTROL`, `USE_VTX_SMARTAUDIO`, `USE_VTX_TRAMP`, `USE_VTX_MSP`, `USE_CMS`.

## 2. Interface facts
- Packet sizes accepted as assumed: SITL logs `new fdm 144` and `new rc 40` on the first packets; motor replies are 16-byte `servo_packet`s on UDP 9002 (sent to `127.0.0.1` by default, `--ip` changes it).
- UART1 binds `tcp://127.0.0.1:5761` at startup ("bind port 5761 for UART1"); MSP over it works: `MSP_API_VERSION` → `00 01 30` (MSP protocol 0, API 1.48); `MSP_ATTITUDE` → (0.0, 0.0, 0) for a level, still FDM feed.
- `--config <file>` works: applies the CLI file, prints `[CONFIG] Config file processed, EEPROM saved`, writes `eeprom.bin` in the working directory and exits.
- Stock build (no `GYROPID_SYNC`), harness doing send→wait-for-reply at a 1 kHz simulated rate, inside WSL: **2969/3000 replies, 3.0 s simulated in 57.4 s wall** (31 timeouts of 0.5 s each account for ~15 s; the rest is ~14 ms per exchange).
- **SITL's clock does not track the FDM timestamps.** Its `micros()` integrates wall time × `simRate`, where `simRate` is re-estimated from packet spacing. Under request/response pacing this collapses: after 3.0 s of simulated time SITL's clock read ≈ 0.66 s (its 1 Hz-real-time status line advanced only 3–5 ms of SITL time per print). Consequence: Betaflight's loop timing, boot grace and RX timeouts run on a different timebase from the physics. Task 4 evaluates `GYROPID_SYNC` and an external-time patch.
- Boot arming flags seen with the spike diff while disarmed: `RXLOSS ANGLE BOOTGRACE` → `RXLOSS BOOTGRACE` (expected during boot; arming is exercised in Task 3).
- Configurator: pending user check (desktop Configurator to `tcp://127.0.0.1:5761`).
